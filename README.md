# TechCon 2024 Website Project

## Project Scope

The website will consist of five core webpages:

1. **Homepage (index.html)**: This is the landing page that introduces TechCon 2024 and provides navigation to other sections of the website.
2. **About Page (about.html)**: This page delves into the history, mission, and notable speakers of the TechCon conference.
3. **Schedule Page (schedule.html)**: This webpage presents a detailed schedule of conference events, sessions, and speakers in an accessible table format.
4. **Register Page (register.html)**: This page offers a user-friendly registration form for attendees to sign up for the TechCon conference.
5. **Contact Page (contact.html)**: This webpage provides comprehensive contact information for TechCon, including email address, social media links, an embedded map, and a “Contact Us” form.

## Concepts Covered

Throughout this project, participants will gain practical experience with the following HTML concepts:

- **HTML Structure**: Solidifying understanding of fundamental HTML tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, and their proper usage for website structure and organization.
- **Headings and Text**: Learning to structure headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`) for emphasis and utilizing paragraph tags (`<p>`) and other text formatting elements effectively.
- **Links and Navigation**: Implementing hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) to create navigation menus and link between different webpages within the TechCon website.
- **Tables**: Creating a well-formatted table on the Schedule page to present conference schedules in an organized and easy-to-read manner.
- **Forms**: Designing user-friendly registration and contact forms using the `<form>` tag and various input types (text, email, password, checkbox) to collect attendee information.
- **Images and Multimedia**: Incorporating images (using `<img>` tags with appropriate alt attributes) to enhance the visual appeal of the website. Exploring embedding a promotional video (using the `<video>` tag) and an interactive Google Map (using `<iframe>`) on the Contact page.

By successfully completing this project, participants will gain valuable hands-on experience building a real-world website with HTML. This will serve as a solid foundation for exploring more advanced web development concepts like CSS and JavaScript in the future.
